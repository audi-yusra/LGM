## üßë‚Äçüíª **Code Walkthrough**

### **HTML Structure**
The `index.html` file defines the structure of the Todo List, including the input field, buttons, and task list.

```html
<div class="container">
    <header>
        <h1>Todo List</h1>
        <div class="input-section">
            <input type="text" placeholder="Add a todo . . ." />
            <button class="btn btn-secondary add-task-button">
                <i class="bx bx-plus bx-sm"></i>
            </button>
        </div>
    </header>
    <ul class="todos-list"></ul>
</div>
```

### **CSS Styling**
The `style.css` file provides the visual styling for the app, including layout, colors, and animations.

```css
.container {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
    box-shadow: 0 8px 32px 0 rgba(31, 38, 135, 0.3);
    backdrop-filter: blur(3px);
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 20px;
}
```

### **JavaScript Functionality**
The `main.js` file handles the logic for adding, editing, deleting, and managing todos.

```javascript
function addToDo(task_input) {
    let task = {
        id: getRandomId(),
        task: task_input.value,
        completed: false
    }
    todos.push(task);
}
```

### **Theme Switcher**
The `theme_switcher.js` file allows users to switch between themes and saves the selected theme in local storage.

```javascript
themes.forEach(theme => {
    theme.addEventListener('click', () => {
        const theme_name = theme.getAttribute('theme');
        html.setAttribute('data-theme', theme_name);
        saveTheme(theme_name);
